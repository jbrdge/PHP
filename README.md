Project: Curated Lego Inventory Database

Tools Used:
PHP, JavaScript, HTML, mySQL
Mysql Bash Command Line tools
Myphpadmin
MAMP


This database tool has data collected from the Lego Database files on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/lego-database
"This dataset contains the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database."

I have created a site which makes SQL queries to the database which is stored using MAMP. So far, it has the functionality to sort the files and the tables in order of a column. I also have searches showing connectivity of the relational database in progress. The current relational connect displayed is the connection:
Set Name -> Theme ID -> Theme Name. Which joins the set table and theme tables.

The site also has drop down menus for accessibility and currently displays the first 20 items in all tables except the colors table.

this is the schema for the relationships of the database:

Tracking the setup process:

Problems: phpmyadmin has an 8M limit on uploads that needed to be modified using bash since I do not have a MAMP-pro account.

To access the file that needed to be modified, I went to the file: 
~/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.4.2/conf/php.ini<br>
and I manually edited the following to: <br>
upload_max_filesize = 64M<br>
post_max_size = 64M<br>
max_execution_time = 3000<br>
memorylimit = 512M<br>
This still had issues uploading a file that was ~10M, so I had to upload using bash.

To access the localhost associated with MAMP from the terminal, I typed:
/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql --host=localhost -u root -p

Before uploading the file, I needed to contruct a table with column labels in the command line;
CREATE TABLE InventoryP ( inventory_id INT, part_num VARCHAR(16), color_id INT, quantity INT, is_spare VARCHAR(1));

Once switching to my intended database, I used the command:
LOAD DATA INFILE '…path to file…/inventory_parts.csv' INTO TABLE tablename FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;

But, I received the following access error response presumably from MAMP:

ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement

to check the access, type:
SELECT @@GLOBAL.secure_file_priv;

In my case, at this point the response was:
+---------------------------+<br>
| @@GLOBAL.secure_file_priv |<br>
+---------------------------+<br>
| NULL                      |<br>
+---------------------------+<br>
1 row in set (0.00 sec)<br>

So I exited, stopped the server services and needed to add a file to ~ using the command: 

nano ~/.my.cnf

And added the lines:

[mysqld_safe]
[mysqld]
secure_file_priv="/Users/me/"

Checking my access:

mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.secure_file_priv;<br>
+---------------------------+<br>
| @@GLOBAL.secure_file_priv |<br>
+---------------------------+<br>
| /Users/me/                |<br>
+---------------------------+<br>
1 row in set (0.00 sec)<br>

Now, I was able to upload my file successfully.

The other issue I encountered was that myphpadmin was not ignoring the first line in the csv files and was including the header as a row. I manually edited the columns to the corresponding names using myphpadmin. Then in the terminal, I deleted the rows with

DELETE FROM Inventories where COLUMN_NAME='COLUMN_NAME';

Or whatever the appropriate column name was.
